Data Cleaning Project – Layoffs Dataset

This is my first ever data analytics project using SQL! 🚀  
In this project, I performed data cleaning on a real-world dataset of tech layoffs from 2020 to 2023.

📌 Project Overview

Goal: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis by removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing the data.
Dataset: [Layoffs Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)
Tools Used: MySQL

🧹 Cleaning Steps

Removed duplicates
Standardized company names and text fields
Handled NULL values
Dropped irrelevant columns and rows
Deleted data that was not useful for analysis

🛠️ SQL Techniques Used

`CTEs`
`Joins`
`Window Functions`
`TRIM`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
Subqueries
